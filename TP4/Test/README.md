#### Description:
This Bash script (`Run.sh`) is designed to run the `calculette` program on a set of test files. The script iterates through the test files, executes `calculette` on each file, and displays the results.
This Python script (`Generate.py`) generates arithmetic test expressions and writes them to test files. It can create a mix of valid and intentionally invalid expressions for testing purposes.

#### Usage:
1. Ensure that the `calculette` program is located in the parent directory (`../calculette`).
2. Make sure the script has execution permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Run.sh
3. `` Run Python
   python Generate.py
   
3. `` Run Bash 
   ./Run.sh
